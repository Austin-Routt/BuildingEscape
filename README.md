# BuildingEscape
Unreal Engine Test 1

In the summer of 2019, I had a little time on my hands, so I decided to learn about the unreal engine. 
[Udemy's Unreal course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse) has been my introduction to the game engine and BuildingEscape is 
a room escape game that is used for educational purposes in section 6.
